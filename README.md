# Branch Naming Conventions

To ensure consistency and organization in the development process, the following branch naming conventions should be followed:

- **hotfix/**: Used for quickly fixing critical issues, usually with a temporary solution.
- **bugfix/**: Used for fixing a bug in the application.
- **feature/**: Used for adding, removing, or modifying a feature.
- **test/**: Used for experimenting with something that is not an issue or part of a feature.
- **wip/**: Used for work in progress (ongoing tasks that aren't completed yet).

Please use these naming conventions when creating new branches to maintain clarity and structure across the project.
